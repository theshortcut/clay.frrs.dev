<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>
	I'm currently working at <a href="https://fastly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
		>Fastly</a
	> on the UX Platform team as an Engineering Manager. Before this role, I was a Staff Software Engineer
	on the Web Engineering team.
</p>

<p>
	Before Fastly I worked on various bits of <a
		href="https://weedmaps.com"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">WeedMaps</a
	>, largely focused around their migration from AngularJS to React and Next.js
</p>

<p>
	Prior to that I was an early hire at a startup called SpinGo which eventually became part of <a
		href="https://events.com"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noopener noreferrer">Events.com</a
	>
</p>

<p>Mostly, I just love building things for the web.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>
	I grew up in the Seattle area, attended High School in Oklahoma City, college in Utah and moved to
	Tucson, Arizona shortly after college and have been here since.
</p>

<p>Rachelle and I have 3 amazing kids 👧👦👶 and a Shiba Inu 🐕.</p>

<p>
	When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy soccer, racquetball, tennis, hiking,
	running, or making music playing guitar or drums.
